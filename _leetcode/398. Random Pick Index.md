## Problem

Given an array of integers with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number. You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.

Note:
The array size can be very large. Solution that uses too much extra space will not pass the judge.

Example:

```
int[] nums = new int[] {1,2,3,3,3};
Solution solution = new Solution(nums);

// pick(3) should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.
solution.pick(3);

// pick(1) should return 0. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1.
solution.pick(1);
```

## Code

```java
class Solution {
    int[] nums;
    Random rand;
    public Solution(int[] nums) {
        this.nums = nums;
        rand = new Random();
    }

    public int pick(int target) {
        int res = -1;
        int count = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if(nums[i] == target) {
                if(rand.nextInt(count + 1) == 0) {
                    res = i;
                }
                count++;
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
}

/**
 * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * Solution obj = new Solution(nums);
 * int param_1 = obj.pick(target);
 */
```
