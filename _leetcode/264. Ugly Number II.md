## Problem

Write a program to find the n-th ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5.

Example:

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
```

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = [0] * n
        res[0] = 1
        i2 = 0
        i3 = 0
        i5 = 0

        for i in range(1, n):
            res[i] = min(res[i2] * 2, min(res[i3] * 3, res[i5] * 5))
            if res[i] == res[i2] * 2:
                i2 += 1

            if res[i] == res[i3] * 3:
                i3 += 1

            if res[i] == res[i5] * 5:
                i5 += 1

        return res[-1]
```
