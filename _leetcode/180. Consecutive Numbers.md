## Problem

Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

```
+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  1  |
| 3  |  1  |
| 4  |  2  |
| 5  |  1  |
| 6  |  2  |
| 7  |  2  |
+----+-----+
```

For example, given the above Logs table, 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

```
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
```

## Code

```sql
Select DISTINCT l1.Num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM
Logs l1,
Logs l2,
Logs l3
WHERE l1.Id = l2.Id-1
AND l2.Id = l3.Id-1
AND l1.Num = l2.Num
AND l2.Num = l3.Num
```
