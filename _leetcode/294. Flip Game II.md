## Problem

You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -, you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Write a function to determine if the starting player can guarantee a win.

Example:

```
Input: s = "++++"
Output: true
Explanation: The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle "++" to become "+--+".
```

Follow up:
Derive your algorithm's runtime complexity.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def canWin(self, s: str) -> bool:
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if s[i] == '+' and s[i + 1] == '+':
                # 对手不能赢的情况下
                if not self.canWin(s[:i] + "--" + s[i + 2:]):
                    return True
        # 没有能赢的情况
        return False
```
