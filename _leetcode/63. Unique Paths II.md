## Problem

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

![image tooltip here](/assets/63.png)

An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

Note: m and n will be at most 100.

Example 1:

```
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePathsWithObstacles(int[][] obstacleGrid) {
        int[] dp = new int[obstacleGrid.length];
        dp[0] = 1;

        for (int j = 0; j < obstacleGrid[0].length; j++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < obstacleGrid.length; i++) {
                if (obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1){
                    dp[i] = 0;
                } else if (i > 0) {
                    dp[i] += dp[i - 1];
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[obstacleGrid.length - 1];
    }
}
```
