## Problem
Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:
```
Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
```
## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        if not citations:
            return 0
        
        start = 0
        end = len(citations) - 1
        
        while start + 1 < end:
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            
            if citations[mid] == len(citations) - mid:
                return len(citations) - mid
            elif citations[mid] > len(citations) - mid:
                end = mid
            else:
                start = mid
        
        if citations[start] >= len(citations) - start:
            return len(citations) - start
        
        if citations[end] >= len(citations) - end:
            return len(citations) - end
        
        return 0
```

```python
class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 1
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(citations) - 1, -1, -1):
            if count <= citations[i]:
                res = count
            
            count += 1
        
        return res
```
