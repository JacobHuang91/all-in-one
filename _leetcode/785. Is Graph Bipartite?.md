## Problem

There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:

There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).
There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).
If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).
The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.
A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.

Return true if and only if it is bipartite.

Example 1:

```
Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.
```

Example 2:

![image tooltip here](./assets/785-2.jpeg)

```
Input: graph = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: We can partition the nodes into two sets: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
```

## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isBipartite(int[][] graph) {
        int[] colors = new int[graph.length];

        for (int i = 0; i < graph.length; i++) {
            if (colors[i] == 0) {
                // 相邻的点染成不同的颜色，这样就可以把他们分到不同的组了
                // 1和-1表示两种颜色,0表示还没有染色
                if (!dfs(graph, colors, 1, i)) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }

        return true;
    }

    private boolean dfs(int[][] graph, int[] colors, int color, int curr) {
        colors[curr] = color;
        for (int next : graph[curr]) {
            // 相邻的点具有相同的颜色
            if (colors[next] == color) return false;
            // 相邻的点还没有染色,但是不能染成相反的颜色
            if (colors[next] == 0 && !dfs(graph, colors, -color, next)) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isBipartite(int[][] graph) {
        int[] colors = new int[graph.length];

        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < graph.length; i++) {
            if (colors[i] == 0) {
                queue.offer(i);
                // 染色成1
                colors[i] = 1;

                while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
                    int curr = queue.poll();
                    for (int next : graph[curr]) {
                        if (colors[next] == colors[curr]) return false;
                        if (colors[next] != 0) continue;

                        colors[next] = -colors[curr];
                        queue.offer(next);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```
