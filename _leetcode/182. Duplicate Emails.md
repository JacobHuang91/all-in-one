## Problem

Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.

```
+----+---------+
| Id | Email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
```

For example, your query should return the following for the above table:

```
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
```

## Code

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT Email
FROM (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS num, Email
    FROM Person
    GROUP BY Email
) AS temp
WHERE temp.num >= 2
```
