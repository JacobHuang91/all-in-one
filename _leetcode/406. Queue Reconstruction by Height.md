## Problem

You are given an array of people, people, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each people[i] = [hi, ki] represents the ith person of height hi with exactly ki other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to hi.

Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array people. The returned queue should be formatted as an array queue, where queue[j] = [hj, kj] is the attributes of the jth person in the queue (queue[0] is the person at the front of the queue).

Example 1:

```
Input: people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]
Output: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]
Explanation:
Person 0 has height 5 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 1 has height 7 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 2 has height 5 with two persons taller or the same height in front, which is person 0 and 1.
Person 3 has height 6 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Person 4 has height 4 with four people taller or the same height in front, which are people 0, 1, 2, and 3.
Person 5 has height 7 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Hence [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] is the reconstructed queue.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: people = [[6,0],[5,0],[4,0],[3,2],[2,2],[1,4]]
Output: [[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[1,4],[6,0]]
```

## Code

1. 最矮的一群人和其他人无关
2. 最矮的人可以最后再放, 只要根据他的 index 放, 就都是符合要求的, 所以先按照从高到矮排序，然后按照 k 从小到大排序

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[][] reconstructQueue(int[][] people) {
        Arrays.sort(people, (new Comparator<int[]>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(int[] o1, int[] o2) {
                // 如果高低相同就按照k进行排序
                // [5,0] [5,1]
                if (o1[0] == o2[0]) {
                    return o1[1] - o2[1];
                // 按照由高到低排序
                // [7,2] [5,1]
                } else {
                    return o2[0] - o1[0];
                }
            }
        }));

        // [7,0][7,1][6,1][5,0][5,1][4,4]
        List<int[]> resultList = new LinkedList<>();

        // 按照k插入数据
        // add的第一个参数是要插入的位置
        for(int[] cur : people){
            resultList.add(cur[1], cur);
        }
        return resultList.toArray(new int[people.length][]);
    }
}
```
