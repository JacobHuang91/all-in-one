## Problem

There is a fence with n posts, each post can be painted with one of the k colors.

You have to paint all the posts such that no more than two adjacent fence posts have the same color.

Return the total number of ways you can paint the fence.

Note:
n and k are non-negative integers.

Example:

```
Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: Take c1 as color 1, c2 as color 2. All possible ways are:

            post1  post2  post3
 -----      -----  -----  -----
   1         c1     c1     c2
   2         c1     c2     c1
   3         c1     c2     c2
   4         c2     c1     c1
   5         c2     c1     c2
   6         c2     c2     c1
```

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def numWays(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        if n == 1:
            return k
        if n == 2:
            return k * k
        dp = [0] * n
        dp[0] = k
        dp[1] = k * k

        for i in range(2, n):
            # 涂上和之前第一个post不同的颜色
            # 涂上和之前第二个post不同的颜色
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] * (k - 1) + dp[i - 2] * (k - 1)

        return dp[n - 1]
```
