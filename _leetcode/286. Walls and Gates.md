## Problem
You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.

-1 - A wall or an obstacle.
0 - A gate.
INF - Infinity means an empty room. We use the value 231 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than 2147483647.
Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with INF.

Example: 

Given the 2D grid:
```
INF  -1  0  INF
INF INF INF  -1
INF  -1 INF  -1
  0  -1 INF INF
```
After running your function, the 2D grid should be:
```
  3  -1   0   1
  2   2   1  -1
  1  -1   2  -1
  0  -1   3   4
```
## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def helper(self, i: int, j: int, step: int, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        if i < 0 or i >= len(rooms) or j < 0 or j >= len(rooms[0]): 
            return
        
        if rooms[i][j] < step:
            return

        rooms[i][j] = step
        
        self.helper(i + 1, j, step + 1, rooms)
        self.helper(i - 1, j, step + 1, rooms)
        self.helper(i, j + 1, step + 1, rooms)
        self.helper(i, j - 1, step + 1, rooms)
