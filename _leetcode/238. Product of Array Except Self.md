## Problem
Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Example:
```
Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```
Constraint: It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any prefix or suffix of the array (including the whole array) fits in a 32 bit integer.

Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).

Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = []
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            res.append(1)
        
        curr = nums[0]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            res[i] = curr
            curr *= nums[i]
        
        curr = nums[-1]
        for i in range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1):
            res[i] *= curr
            curr *= nums[i]
        
        return res
```
