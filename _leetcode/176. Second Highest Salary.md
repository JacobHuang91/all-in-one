## Problem

Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

```
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```

For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

```
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
```

## Code

```SQL
# Write your MySQL query statement below
# 防止只有一个record，可以使用IFNULL
SELECT
IFNULL(
(SELECT DISTINCT Salary
FROM Employee
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1), NULL)
AS SecondHighestSalary
```

```SQL
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
(
SELECT DISTINCT Salary
FROM Employee
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
)
AS SecondHighestSalary
```
