## Problem

Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
Note: This question is the same as 1038: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-to-greater-sum-tree/

Example 1:

![image tooltip here](./assets/538.png)

```
Input: root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: root = [0,null,1]
Output: [1,null,1]
```

Example 3:

```
Input: root = [1,0,2]
Output: [3,3,2]
```

Example 4:

```
Input: root = [3,2,4,1]
Output: [7,9,4,10]
```

## Code

后续遍历

```java
class Solution {
   private int sum = 0;

    public TreeNode convertBST(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return null;
        convertBST(root.right);
        sum += root.val;
        root.val = sum;
        convertBST(root.left);
        return root;
    }
}
```

stack

```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode convertBST(TreeNode root) {
        int sum = 0;
        TreeNode node = root;
        Stack<TreeNode> stack = new Stack<>();

        while (!stack.isEmpty() || node != null) {
            while (node != null) {
                stack.add(node);
                node = node.right;
            }

            node = stack.pop();
            sum += node.val;
            node.val = sum;

            node = node.left;
        }

        return root;
    }
}
```
