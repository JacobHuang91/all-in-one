## Problem
You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -, you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Write a function to compute all possible states of the string after one valid move.

Example:
```
Input: s = "++++"
Output: 
[
  "--++",
  "+--+",
  "++--"
]
```
Note: If there is no valid move, return an empty list [].



## Code

不要对string进行直接修改，比如
```python
x[i] = 'w'
```

可以使用
```python
s = "hello world"
arr = list(s)
arr[3] = 't'
s_new = "".join(arr)
```

```python
class Solution:
    def generatePossibleNextMoves(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        arr = []
        
        for i in range(0, len(s) - 1):
            if s[i] == '+' and s[i + 1] == '+':
                arr.append(s[:i] + "--" + s[i + 2:])
        
        return arr
```
