# Design Distributed Logging System

# Step 1: Understand the problem and establish design scope

## 1.1 Questions and answers

- Is it for a distributed system?
- What is the most important features for logging system?
- Can we retrieve logs based on filters?
- Do we need to send alerts when error logs?

## 1.2 Requirements

- Distributed logging system
- Centralized logging
- Centralized log tracing
- Generate reports to get specific type of error
- Alert mechanism based on errors

# Step 2: Propose high-level design and get buy-in

## 2.1 Monolithic vs Distributed System Logging

# Step 3: Design deep dive

## 3.1 Log shipper

You need a log shipper which can read the log from your directories or containers and ship them to the next place. This log shipper needs to have less resource footprint. You donâ€™t want your logging application to take down your main application.

There are a few good log shippers present that can help you. Fluentd, rsyslog, logstash, etc can be a good choice.

## 3.2 Other

- Add Machine/Instance/Service ID into logs before sending to Log Parser
- Logs come from different services developed by different tech stacks, so we need log parser to format logs and then send to queue
- We should send emails/notifications to dev for important logs
