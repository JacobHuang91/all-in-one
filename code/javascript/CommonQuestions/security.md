# XSS

Cross-site Scripting (XSS) is a client-side code injection attack. The attacker aims to execute malicious scripts in a web browser.

example:
Malicious JavaScript has access to all the objects that the rest of the web page has access to. This includes access to the user’s **cookies**. Cookies are often used to store session tokens. If an attacker can obtain a user’s session cookie, they can impersonate that user, perform actions on behalf of the user, and gain access to the user’s sensitive data.

# CSRF

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re currently authenticated.

# CSRF token

A CSRF token is a unique, secret, unpredictable value that is **generated by the server-side** application and transmitted to the client in such a way that it is **included in a subsequent HTTP request** made by the client. When the later request is made, the server-side application validates that the request includes the expected token and rejects the request if the token is missing or invalid.

example:
在 get 中，通过脚本换了收款人，收到了转账的钱
